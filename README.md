# GUI-Pathfinding-Algorithms
JavaFX GUI based java application for visualising different pathfinding algorithms
-Changes in terrain are drawn by clicking or dragging left mouse click
  * Obstacle : non passable grid square
  * Clear : passable grid with cost 1
  * Rough : grid with cost 4
  * Rougher : grid with cost 7
-Diagonal and right angle movements have the same cost
-Right clicking selects the Start/End node in the grid
